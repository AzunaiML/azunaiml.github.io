This is simple one page website for online Daily Scrum Meetings. 

## What is Daily Scrum Meeting?

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team. The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint. At it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours. This optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting upcoming Sprint work. The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity.
Every team member should answer 3 simple questions:
- What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
- What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
- Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

### Choose random speaker

When we know it will be our turn to speak next in a meeting, many of us tune out the current speaker while we mentally prepare what weâ€™ll say. To fix this problem there is random selection of the next speaker.

First of all you have to add your team members on the dashboard.
You can do that by clicking "insert team members" and filling form like on gif animation below:

After that you could randomly select next speaker by clicking on "Next speaker" button. If you want to start over click "Reset" button. See gif below:

### Don't discuss problems - park them

When someone have problem - don't discuss it during meeting - use parking on right board. 
Write team members, who have problem or can help with it, in "team members" field.
Briefly write problem in "your problem" field.
